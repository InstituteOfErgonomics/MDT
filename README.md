The Mobile Detection Task (MDT) is a derivative of the Detection Response Tasks (see e.g. http://www.lfe.mw.tum.de/en/arduino-drt) allowing mobile, wireless experimentation through the use of a nomadic device (Android smart phone). Since the MDT is not within the DRT ISO Standard (currently under development), this task is referred to a MDT rather than a DRT, despite similar task qualities.

The basic idea behind the MDT is to implement the DRT protocol on a smart phone and to use the hardware of the device (touch screen, display, vibration motor, WLAN, etc.) to asses the attentive effects of cognitive workload. The display (visual) and vibration motor (tactile) are used to present participants with signals, and the touch screen or an external button can be used to communicate participant responses. Data can be logged locally on the system or smart phone and can even be wirelessly transmitted (depending on the phones capabilities). These connections can also be used to control and monitor an experiment.

All these capabilities are possible with the use of a single device you already likely possess! In order to get started with this setup, you will need to download the software we provide here on the site listed below (provided free of charge, so fear not). This source is intentionally open source (GPL) so that you can adjust it to your project needs.

Important note: The absolute reaction time values are not as accurate as you may expect (see e.g., measurements at http://www.lfe.mw.tum.de/en/mdt). Nevertheless, sometimes useful to compare relatively experimental conditions or different systems under test.

If you connect wires and equipment to a subject, please do so with caution and take precautionary measures (e.g. beware of electrical safety, etc.).

If experimental setups include a driving task, special care must be taken. e.g. no cables or device parts should interfere with being able to safely perform the driving task. As a general piece of advice, please think about what can fail while preparing the experiment (something becomes loose or gets stuck to other parts,...) and take every measure possible to avoid such occurrences.
